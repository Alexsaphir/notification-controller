# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## 1.0.0-rc.1

**Release date:** 2023-03-30

This release candidate promotes the Receiver API from v1beta2 to v1. The Receiver v1 API now supports triggering the reconciliation of multiple 
resources using match labels.

### Highlights

#### API changes

The `Receiver` kind was promoted from v1beta2 to v1 (GA). All other kinds of the notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io group stay at version v1beta2.

The receivers.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io CRD contains the following versions:

- v1 (storage version)
- v1beta2 (deprecated)
- v1beta1 (deprecated)

#### Upgrade Procedure

The `Receiver` v1 API is backwards compatible with v1beta2.

To upgrade from v1beta2, after deploying the new CRD and controller, set `apiVersion: notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1` in the YAML files that 
contain `Receiver` definitions. Bumping the API version in manifests can be done gradually. It is advised to not delay this procedure as the beta 
versions will be removed after 6 months.

custom resources upgrade to `v1beta2`.

Fixes:
* Remove interval default value from CRDs
  [#457](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/457)

## 0.30.1

**Release date:** 2022-12-21

when the Kubernetes conversion webhook upgrades the Provider and Receiver
custom resources from `v1beta1`to `v1beta2` without setting the
default value for `spec.interval`.

Fixes:
* Fix panic when upgrading to v1beta2
  [#455](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/455)

## 0.30.0

**Release date:** 2022-12-20

This prerelease graduates the notification APIs to `v1beta2`.
In addition, this version comes with support for
[Gitea commit status updates](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/api/v0.30.0/docs/spec/v1beta2/providers.md#gitea).

### `notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2`

After upgrading the controller to v0.30.0, you need to update the notification
**Custom Resources** in Git
by replacing `notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1` with
`notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2` in all YAML manifests.

#### Breaking changes

- The `Alert.spec.summary` has a max length of 255 characters.
- The `Provider.spec.address` and `Provider.spec.proxy` have a max length of 2048 characters.
- The `Receiver.status.url` was deprecated in favour of `Receiver.status.webhookPath`.

#### API specifications in a user-friendly format

[The new specifications for the `v1beta2` API](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/tree/v0.30.0/docs/spec/v1beta2)
have been written in a new format with the aim to be more valuable to a user.
Featuring separate sections with examples, and information on how to write
and work with them.

#### Enhanced Kubernetes Conditions

Notification API resources will now advertise more explicit Condition types,
provide `Reconciling` and `Stalled` Conditions where applicable for
[better integration with `kstatus`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/blob/master/pkg/kstatus/README.md#conditions),
and record the Observed Generation on the Condition.

#### Enhanced Git commit status updates

Starting with this version, the controller uses the `Provider` cluster assigned `UID`
to compose a unique Git commit status ID to avoid name collisions
when multiple clusters write to the same repository.

Improvements:
* Refactor reconcilers and introduce v1beta2 API
  [#435](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/435)
- feat: add gitea notifier

## 0.27.0

**Release date:** 2022-09-27

This prerelease comes with strict validation rules for API fields which define a
(time) duration. Effectively, this means values without a time unit (e.g. `ms`,
`s`, `m`, `h`) will now be rejected by the API server. To stimulate sane
configurations, the units `ns`, `us` and `Âµs` can no longer be configured, nor
can `h` be set for fields defining a timeout value.

In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated
to Kubernetes controller-runtime v0.13.

:warning: **Breaking changes:**

with the Kubernetes structured logging. For more details on the new logging
structure please see: [fluxcd/flux2#3051](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/issues/3051).

## 0.22.0

**Release date:** 2022-02-16

## 0.21.0

**Release date:** 2022-01-28

This prerelease comes with security improvements for multi-tenant clusters.

Platform admins can disable cross-namespace references with the
`--no-cross-namespace-refs=true` flag.
When this flag is set, alerts can only refer to event sources in the same namespace
as the alert object, preventing tenants from subscribing to another tenant's events.

Starting with this version, the controller deployment conforms to the
Kubernetes [restricted pod security standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted):
- all Linux capabilities were dropped
- the root filesystem was set to read-only
- the seccomp profile was set to the runtime default
- run as non-root was enabled
- the user and group ID was set to 65534

**Breaking changes**:
- The use of new seccomp API requires Kubernetes 1.19.
- The controller container is now executed under 65534:65534 (userid:groupid).
  This change may break deployments that hard-coded the user ID of 'controller' in their PodSecurityPolicy.

Features:
* Pass headers to generic provider through secretRef
  [#317](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/317)

Improvements:
* Allow disabling cross-namespace event sources
  [#319](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/319)

  [#308](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/308)
* Update development documentation
  [#309](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/309)

Fixes:

* Downgrade fluxcd/pkg/apis/meta to v0.10.2
  [#303](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/303)
* Add timestamp as label for Prometheus Alertmanager
  [#298](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/298)

## 0.20.0

**Release date:** 2022-01-11

This prerelease comes with an update to the Kubernetes and controller-runtime dependencies
to align them with the Kubernetes 1.23 release.

## 0.19.0

**Release date:** 2021-11-23

This prerelease introduces the `Reconciling` and `Stalled` Condition Types
to indicate if a resource is under reconciliation, or has failed to reach
a `Ready==True` state. This is most beneficial to consumers making use of
[`kstatus`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cli-utils/blob/master/pkg/kstatus/README.md),
which uses the information to return early instead of timing out.

It introduces support for Slack apps bots. See the
[Provider spec](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/blob/v0.19.0/docs/spec/v1beta1/provider.md#slack-app)
for more information on how to get started.

Lastly, `controller-runtime` has been updated to `v0.10.2`, solving an
issue with `rest_client_request_latency_seconds_.*` high cardinality
metrics.

Improvements:
* Add support for Slack app
  [#245](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/245)
* chore: Drop deprecated io/ioutil
  [#277](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/277)
* Use condition helpers in reconciler (kstatus compat)
  [#282](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/282)
* Update Alpine to v3.14
  [#285](https://github.com/fluxcd/notification-controller/pull/285)

The event server exposes HTTP request metrics to track the amount of rate limited events.

```
rate(gotk_event_http_request_duration_seconds_count{code="429"}[30s])

## 0.7.0

**Release date:** 2021-01-22

This is the seventh MINOR prerelease.

The `Receiver` API gains a new webhook type called `generic-hmac`,
that validates the caller legitimacy using HMAC signatures.

The `Alert` API comes with support for image update notifications
and is now possible to trigger container image updates to Git
using Sonatype Nexus webhooks.

Two new argument flags are introduced to support configuring the QPS
(`--kube-api-qps`) and burst (`--kube-api-burst`) while communicating
with the Kubernetes API server.

The `LocalObjectReference` from the Kubernetes core has been replaced
with our own, making `Name` a required field. The impact of this should
be limited to direct API consumers only, as the field was already
required by controller logic.
